  <em>Your friendly, lightweight companion built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</em>

## Overview

**Meekaa** is a virtual companion made to interact with users and help them to keep their good habits, for those who struggle to have self control, directly in the browser, and currently using Groq API.  
It combines simple web technologies with AI logic to create a human-like experience.

We are looking forward to giving her more capabilities so she can really force you to do what you should instead of just reminding and talking.
